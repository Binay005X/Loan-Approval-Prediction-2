# Loan-Approval-Prediction-2

# 📌 Project Overview

Loan approval prediction is a classification problem where the objective is to determine whether a loan application should be approved or rejected.

Traditional manual evaluation by loan officers is often time-consuming, subjective, and prone to bias.

Using machine learning models, the decision-making process can be automated, leading to faster, fairer, and more accurate results.

Key influencing factors include:

Demographic factors: Age, marital status, education, employment.

Credit-related factors: Credit score, outstanding debts, repayment history.

Financial factors: Monthly income, loan amount, loan term, debt-to-income ratio.

Behavioral & socio-economic factors: Housing status, type of employment, lifestyle indicators.

# 🏦 Business Problem

Manual loan approvals are biased, inconsistent, and inefficient.

With high volumes of applications, it becomes difficult to process them accurately and fairly.

The goal is to build a predictive model that:

Increases efficiency by automating the process.

Improves accuracy by learning from historical data.

Ensures fairness by applying the same objective rules for all applicants.

Scales easily to handle large volumes of loan applications.

💡 Possible Solutions (Machine Learning Models)

The following models were tested to automate loan approval prediction:

Logistic Regression → Good baseline model for classification.

Decision Tree → Handles non-linear relationships and interpretable rules.

Random Forest → Ensemble method that reduces overfitting and improves generalization.

# 📊 Model Performance

After training and evaluating the models, the results were as follows:

Logistic Regression → ✅ 92% Accuracy

Decision Tree → ✅ 99% Accuracy

Random Forest → ✅ 98% Accuracy
